# coding-quiz-bot
This project contains a Discord bot that generates coding questions to keep users skills sharp, built using discord.js. This project was developed for a #DearJuniorDev channel Quackathon. Currently this bot is capabale of generating a quiz question about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Algorithms, or Data Structures on command, evaluate whether you have chosen the correct answer, and provide feedback based on the answer the user selected. 

Future goals for this app include:
- Expanding the app to cover more topics by adding question libraries for other coding languages (python, SQL, java, C++, etc). 
- Creating a simple database for storing users scores with API routes that can:
  - return a users current(weekly) and lifetime scores as well as their percent correct
  - return an array of the users with the top 10 scores for the week
  - check if a user is already in the database and add them if they are not
  - add points when a user gets a correct answer
  - tally incorrect answers to adjust percent correct when a user gets an incorrect answer
- Finishing functionality on a LeetCode style question generator that uses jest testing to confirm whether the user submitted a valid function in response.

## Bot Commands

**!quiz** - Generates a new trivia question for you to answer based on which language you would like a question about. 

**!interview** - Generates a question about algorithms or data structures you may be asked about in an interview. 

_Functions still in development._

**!question** - Generates a coding challenge for you to complete (like codewars or LeetCode!)

**!myScore** - Can be used to see what your score is for the current week or your lifetime score.

**!leaderboards** - Shows the top ten coding masters based on their score for answering questions. Resets weekly.

# Running the Bot Locally

- Install Node JS
- Create a Discord app on on the Developer Portal, add a bot with applications.commands and bot permissions. The bot must be able to read messages/view channels, send messages, and embed links.
- Clone and open the project
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Create a .env file following the instructions in the .env.sample file
- Run the app using `npm run start`
